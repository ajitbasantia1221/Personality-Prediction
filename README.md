PROJECT : Personality Prediction Based On Social Media Posts

INTRODUCTION : The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like "ISTJ" or "ENFP".We will develop a project based on MBTI. People used to post many things on Social Media like Facebook,Twitter,Instagram etc.Here we are going to predict the personality of that random person based on our Machine Learning models.
